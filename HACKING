Development:

Ensure sbcl is installed. Then...
wget -c http://beta.quicklisp.org/quicklisp.lisp;
sbcl --load quicklisp.lisp # and type (quicklisp-quickstart:install) when prompted, then (ql:add-to-init-file)

Afterwards, you may work on paktahn as follows:

 % sbcl
 * (ql:quickload 'paktahn)
 * (in-package :pak)
 * (ensure-initial-cache) ; load the package cache. you might need it.
 ; write some code and test it at the REPL
 ; write tests for it and run them as follows...
 * (asdf:oos 'asdf:test-op 'paktahn)
 * (quit) ; eventually get bored and leave

Also see dev-install.sh if you wish to replace your local paktahn with your development code.
