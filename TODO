planned features for 0.9.7:

  * pak -U support for local packages (Trevis, Issue #57)
  -- Reported by Zarhn, preliminary work by wh5a/wei_hu.

  * test suite using fiveam or eos. Major source reorg here. (Brit)
  -- Should have regression tests for all bugfixes to date. What code coverage?

  * pak -Si support and cleanup

planned features for 0.9.8:

  * find-package-by-name should return lists of (name ver desc provides) for
    both aur and non-aur packages. currently non-aur are (db name ver desc).
    will this break any callers of f-p-b-n?

  * Issue #16, #40, others?

  * Ensure you can install haskell-criterion or similar packages.

  * Figure out what to do about the caching TODOs, especially MAYBE-REFRESH-CACHE.

  * CONTRIBUTING or STYLE file. Maybe BUGS too.

  * multiple commands in succession

later:

  * on first startup ask the user which color scheme and pacman wrapper to use.

  * port to CCL for smaller binary, no 64-bit build problems. just needs SIGINT.

  * port to ECL for super small binaries. Both ports depend on AUR pkgs...

  * find a better way to manage TODOs and FIXMEs than grep...

  * website, proper help/docs

  * make SIGINT quit while in *any* error handler, not just one caused by
    SIGINT itself.

  * compile packages from repos (yaourt -Sb)

  * add md5/sha1 (makepkg -g) if they are missing, after asking the user

  * URI: download pkgbuild or tarball and process it

  * better support for standardized colored output
    (e.g. highlight repos in info messages, support nested progress levels)

  * sorting the output of an AUR search ie. alphabetically, votes,
    date submitted, last updated etc. (by quigybo)

  * actively support versioned deps

  * if invoked as root drop privileges for building packages

  * start querying aur in a separate thread while
    searching local

  * smart regexp/wildcard mode (detect ^ $ * ?)

  * list package group members

  * allow Ctrl+C to stop searching and present the choices gathered
    up to that point right away

  * support su (and friends) besides sudo

  * show dep chain

  * don't offer restarts if there are no packages left in the
    install queue and the only restarts are SKIP and QUIT.

  * remove stale pacman locks as part of RUN-PACMAN's unwind-protect

  * detect stale pacman locks

  * interrupt: offer continue restart

  * show backtrace/enter debugger restart

  * show summary of what has been done before exit
