  * Add Support for pacman 3.5 and libaplm 3.6 (Issue #45 etc.)

0.9.4
=====
  * Add support for all -Q* and -D* (query and database) combinations.

    combinations like -Rcuns. Previously we only supported plain -R.

  * pak -V now also displays the pacman version.

=====
  * Add pak -Syu --aur, -Sy and -Su. These simply call out to pacman
    and (in the case of -Syu --aur) perform additional paktahn work.

  * Ignore versioning for packages whose names end with -git, -svn,
    -hg, -darcs, -bzr or -cvs. (Issue #34, reported by gour)

  * Ensure that requests to install a nonexisting package via
    pak -S properly inform the user that no such package was
    found and offer restarts. (Issue #38)

  * Ensure there is always a default when the user is prompted to
    continue building a package. Letter representing default is
    capitalized as before. (Issues #33 and #36)

  * Prompt to install binary package dependencies first when
    building AUR packages.

0.9.2
=====
  * Always allow users to edit the PKGBUILD. (reported by jiyunatori)

  * Add pak -Ss which behaves identically to pacman -Ss.

  * Ensure implicit pacman/makepkg deps are installed before running
    makepkg.

0.9.1
=====
  * pak -Su --aur now handles deleted or missing packages rather than exiting

  * paktahn will never prompt to reinstall up-to-date dependencies

  * pak -G for core/extra/community packages fetches from svn/trunk
    instead of svn/$arch/pkg-name (#19, reported by wh5a [Wei Hu])

    to overwrite or resume if the tarball exists (#25)

    with pak -G pkgnames (Brit)
