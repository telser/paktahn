Release Procedure:

0) If necessary, update the *paktahn-version* in main.lisp. Don't commit yet! :)
1) Update the PKGBUILD version to the desired version number. If necessary, update the paktahn-makedeps version as well.
2) Run ./build-tarball.sh. This should produce a file named paktahn-{pkgver}.tar.bz2 in the current dir.
3) Copy that file to redlinernotes.com/docs/. ... You may need redline6561 for this. If necessary, do makedeps too.
4) Update checksums in the PKGBUILD. Ensure NEWS and README are acceptably ready. Commit PKGBUILD as "{pkgver}: Release - etc"
5) Run ./make-aur-tarball.sh and upload the resulting paktahn-{pkgver}-src.tar.gz file to the AUR.
6) Use makepkg -s and upload the resulting binary packages (for x86-64 and x86) to redlinernotes.com/docs/.
